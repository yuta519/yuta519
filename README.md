## My interests
- Architecture Design
  - Learned some architecture designs like DDD, Modular Monolith, and MVC.
  - Architecture designs are absolutely important for the team to make high efficiency.
  - I'm interested in how to build well-architected designs.
- Readable Codes
  - Nowadays, software engineering is a team job.
  - It means readable codes are extremely significant for members to collaborate.

    Improving the Design of Existing Code](https://martinfowler.com/books/refactoring.html) and [The Art of Readable Code](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/the-art-of/9781449318482/)

  - I believe that great teams can achieve the best things that one genius does.
  - Like to collaborate not only with other developers but also with business members.
  - Be curious about how to get the most out of your team
